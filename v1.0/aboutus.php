      <h1>Our Mission Statement </h1>
      <p> We are a group of web developers aiming to tackle the global issue on food waste.  Our goal was to create a web application that would allow us to bring communities together to reduce the amount of annual food waste. </p>

      <p>We define a community as people you interact closely with on a daily basis including at home, in the office, and student dormitories. Food waste is
        reduced by having our users share leftover food in a fridge with other registered members in a close community.</p>

      <p>We honestly strive and hope that like-minded people will use our app and work with us in accomplishing our
        vision on environmental sustainability through food waste reduction.
